                <p>I am a chemisty scientist and I make a lot of chemicals that relate to our life, such as drugs and soap.<br> As people say: chemists are all good cookers", I am a good cooker. Due to long time training and practice in lab, I do well at following the reciept. To me cooking is the same as making chemistals, so I can make most dish if I have the reciept.</p>
                <p>I like all things about flowers. I make a colorful and fragrant "padding" for my hourse by planting different flowers. I very love this padding, it makes me feel relax and comfortable. </p>
